 Alright, so you guys also wanted a crypto funding our crypto based system planer. So this is likely pretty simple. This is very like a lot of bomb-based straights and old school like the fun and trades except crypto is more fun right. So the basic idea here is that crypto people are nuts into generates and you know Bitcoin is not enough they need 50 times better Bitcoin and part-time right and so we have potential futures which give retail investors or investors in general massive leverage and the way that a potential future works is that it has a funding rate which is established on a market basis based on supply and demand so there's a lot of excess demand to get wrong farcoin that's people buying far coin purpose they're gonna push up the implied funding in the purpose so that the longs are gonna have to pay the shorts a fairly high amount on regular basis if a lot of shorts come in everybody wants a short for a coin that's gonna push the other way where shorts are gonna have to pay longs but in general especially in a crypto market everybody wants to be lever long so the funding gets extremely high now what that means is if you understand how to do these things you can short the curb you can buy the cash right you can buy the actual coin the token and in many times get 50% 100% return per year annualized on a market neutral delta neutral basis where your risks are primarily you know operational risk exchange risk managing margin all these kinds of things you know that the sort of esoteric risks of crypto and you know I think there's many hundreds of tokens that have potential futures on them if you understand how to move collateral quickly between exchanges you understand how to manage your risk you know this can be a really interesting thing to do you know why are those spreads so large but then if you look for example at like Bitcoin CME spreads that are very narrow the bottom line is like Bitcoin CME is really easy to do there's no operational risk it's a vanilla product now so everybody can do it so of course it's not interesting right you're getting paid to take risk that other people don't know how to take cheers
